## Dependencies Installation Guide

CarMedic relies on several dependencies to function correctly. Below is a guide on how to install each dependency:

### Node.js and npm

CarMedic is built using Node.js and npm. Ensure you have them installed on your system.

1. **Node.js**: Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
2. **npm**: npm is included with Node.js. Verify the installation by running:
    ```bash
    node -v
    npm -v
    ```

### Project Dependencies

After cloning the repository and navigating to the project directory, install the project dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

This command will install all the required packages listed in the `package.json` file.

### Additional Dependencies

If your project uses additional tools or libraries, ensure they are installed as well. For example:

- **Express**: A web framework for Node.js.
    ```bash
    npm install express
    ```
- **Mongoose**: A MongoDB object modeling tool.
    ```bash
    npm install mongoose
    ```

Refer to the `package.json` file for a complete list of dependencies and their versions.

### Database Setup

If your project requires a database, follow the setup instructions for your specific database. For example, if using MongoDB:

1. Install MongoDB from [mongodb.com](https://www.mongodb.com/).
2. Start the MongoDB server:
    ```bash
    mongod
    ```

### Environment Variables

Ensure you have all necessary environment variables set up. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your variables there. For example:

```
DB_CONNECTION=mongodb://localhost:27017/carmedic
PORT=3000
```

Refer to the project documentation for a complete list of required environment variables.

### Database Setup

CarMedic uses Firebase as its database. Follow these steps to set up Firebase for your project:

1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Create a new project or select an existing project.
3. In the project overview, click on the web icon to set up Firebase for a web app.
4. Register your app and copy the Firebase configuration object.
5. Install Firebase in your project:
    ```bash
    npm install firebase
    ```
6. Create a `firebase.js` file in your project and initialize Firebase with your configuration:
    ```javascript
    import firebase from 'firebase/app';
    import 'firebase/firestore';

    const firebaseConfig = {
        apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
        authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
        projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
        storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
        messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
        appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
    };

    firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);

    const db = firebase.firestore();

    export { db };
    ```

### Environment Variables

Ensure you have all necessary environment variables set up. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your Firebase configuration variables there. For example:

```
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=YOUR_APP_ID
```

Refer to the Firebase documentation for more details on setting up and using Firebase in your project.

By following these steps, you should have Firebase set up and configured correctly for the CarMedic project.
